We can clearly see that the Central region is the most expensive with an average prices almost double that of the other regions. The number of houses in that regions was 505 that made it the 2nd largest after the South regions, that was actually a region with a low average price. The Central region has also the highest standard deviation that tells me that there are many different types of housing in that area and both ends of the prices.
